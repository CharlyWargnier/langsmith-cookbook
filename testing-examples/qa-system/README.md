# Testing and Evaluation for Q&A Systems

The notebooks in this directory show a couple of ways to use criteria evaluators to grade a question-answering system based on the context that it fetches.


For simple examples checking for hallucinations and faithfulness in the output, see one of the following notebooks:
- For an example evaluating a `RetrievalQA` chain, check out [Checking for Hallucinations in a RetrievalQA Chain](qa-system-retrievalqa)
- For an example evaluating a retrieval Q&A chain built using langchain expressions, check out [Checking for Hallucinations in a Q&A System](qa-system-lcel)
