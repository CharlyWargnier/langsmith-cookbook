# Exploratory Data Analysis

Once you've logged your trace data, there is a wealth of insight you can glean from analyzing the logs. Use them for fine-tuning, to build better eval suites, to drive product insights, and more. The following are some example notebooks showing how you can export the data to other tools for analysis.
